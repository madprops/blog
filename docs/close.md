# Close

Lots about how to open/launch programs is discussed often, but what about the ways to close/hide them?

I'd say the way we get rid of what we don't need at the moment anymore is equally important.

## Closing

I don't use window decorations at all, so no X button to click.

90% of the time I close windows by double clicking the DPI button of my mouse.

This is a button that sits at the top of the mouse, and it's meant to be used to change the DPI (sensitivity).

But I mapped it to somethign else, and if I double click it quick enough it closes the window where the cursor is at.

So I just point to a window and tap tap, done. It's really fast.

On rare ocassions I use alt+f4, or Close in a right click menu I made, but the DPI method is the preferred one.

## Hiding

A lot of the time I don't want to close a window, just make it get out of the way.

Since I don't have a minimize button I mapped a side button of my mouse.

So I just point to the window and click the button. Similar to the DPI method.

## Mouse

Why so mouse-focused? A lot of the time I'm in cruising mode (One hand on my mouse, the other hand resting)

The more I can do with my mouse the better. This way I can open, close, hide, whatever, using a single hand.
