# Close

Lots about how to launch programs is discussed often, but what about the ways to close and hide them?

I'd say the way we get rid of what we don't need at the moment anymore is equally important.

## Closing

I don't use window decorations at all, so no X button to click.

90% of the time I close windows by double clicking the DPI button of my mouse.

This is a button that sits at the top of the mouse, and it's meant to be used to change the DPI (sensitivity).

But I mapped it to something else, and if I double click it quick enough it closes the window where the cursor is at.

So I just point to a window and tap tap, done. It's really fast.

## Hiding

A lot of the time I don't want to close a window, I just want to make it get out of the way.

Since I don't have a minimize button I mapped a side button of my mouse to trigger a minimize.

So I just point to the window and click the button. Similar to the DPI method.

## Mouse

Why so mouse-focused? A lot of the time I'm in cruising mode (One hand on my mouse, the other hand resting).

The more I can do with my mouse the better. This way I can open, close, hide, whatever, using a single hand.

## Cursor

The advantage of using the "close/hide the window below the cursor" method is that the whole window is the target.

I don't need to point and click on tiny areas like the minimize/close buttons, I have the whole window area to click.

And not having decorations saves space, plus makes important clickable areas reside at the top, like tabs.

## DPI

Any mouse button that can be mapped works for what I do.

What I do is map the button to a keyboard combo like Ctrl+Alt+Space or whatever.

I do this using an open source software manager for my mouse.

Then in my window manager I map the shortcut to an action.

The DPI button in my mouse is handy because it's at the top, near the middle, easy to reach.

And I have no need to use the intended DPI changing action anyway.

I just let it work at the DPI setting that's most comfortable all the time.

## Taps

I made a library for awesomewm to detect double click/tap/press and perform an action.
