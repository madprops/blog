# Double Tap

In vscode you can map double taps of a key to an action.

For instance, if you hit Shift twice in a row relatively fast, you can trigger something.

This is great if you want a couple of mindless shortcuts that you can just bang like a caveman.

I use Shift and Control. The first one for switching between files, the latter one to go to functions.
