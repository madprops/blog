    <div id="content">~ That seat is taken. How are you? This is called water, now you can learn how to drink. Over here we have the wind, and the friends of the wind. It might have moved you before, do you feel ok? The ticket you showed me is still there. Reading is something you might have started to do. Here are some words:

~ Do you want these words to be selected. Press and I play. A pill is now next to your glass. Tell me something about the rest of the body. Find the body. I can give you a hand and you can take a good look. Moving on, there is that little cave where your face remains, it stays. Do you want me to take a break for you?

~ Finnish your country first before training my replacement. That is something I just said. The fast solution you requested for this meeting is an original choice. Try to understand and I'll meet you there.

~ A just fan is indeed something to bring. There is a painting that wants to see you. Can I have your name already? Font Real? Meeting you should be nice. My name is Del Eec unless you object to that. You look in a certain direction and that interests me today. I know others who have looked in that direction. Can you speak?

-- Yes, hi. Rest in this line of thought I'm providing you.

~ Okay, that sounds fun even if I have laughed enough today. Rented a space to play with your next visit, are you down for it?

-- I'm always down for a visit. Can you fix that?

~ Tell me one thing, I can afford one thing.

-- I'm a Barbie Girl in my Barbie World.

~ What a perspective I now have. Watch the time because it just became entertaining. Would you say?

-- The body remains to be found.

~ It's not that I want you to find it, but it has to be done piece by piece.

~ It's the state we are in that demands a couple of legs. To change seats or walk the way. When are you free?

-- Write now.

~ Sorry I have to go it was actually nice to meet you.

Font Real stayed and was told. Judging by the stair in his face he solved his problem the moment he got along with Del Eec. Right before he learned to use the instrument that would feed his path he wrote the following:

-- I don't care about anything. And you can't make me.

Was that true? Why would he tempt many things to prove him wrong? It had to be true. Call Del Eec.

-- I already called him. What is your name?

I'm Allin. Your head. üò∂‚Äçüå´

-- Help me find the rest of the body.

There's some fingers over there. Your ass is here. I'll pick you up at 12. He didn't listen to that. I have to talk louder.

ASS.

-- Where is Del Eec?

ASS.

-- I have enough fingers to point at you now.

Del Eec arrived and also stayed. Would you like to talk to him?

~ Yes, speak to me, I have something. But first I must point out you are still missing me.

-- You make it sound easy. Every day there's room for this.

-- In my eyes I found this letter, is that what you wanted me to see?

Font Real was allowed in the bus and that allowed him to know how the speed of his heart felt. Knowing this information he was able to attune to the kind of dance that would make his heart get out of bed and make out.

Font Real, give Del Eec a title!

-- Ok, you are a friend with a harmonica.

~ This instrument will help me reveal to you the location of your dick.

Del Eec played the harmonica, quite well. But while that was happening something very hungry was approaching.

-- I have found the body, and I like it.

~ I can tell, it does remind me of you.

-- Do you want a body too?

~ Right now I feel like I could use a body.

-- That was what motivated me, it might work.

Font Real and Del Eec, you are invited to my table where I can take a look at you and demand a favor.

-- You also want a body?

~ Take my remains. My answer is there.

I remembered correctly and it was amazing. I was glad to have lost and found my new friends, yes I think that's happening. You can still call me Allin, would you do that?

-- You gave me a funny face and I want you to know that.

~ You waited in a place not many people wait in.

Right now the body feels complete. Do you want me to look up or down? Don't answer that, instead teach me how to drink water, I can use that. But first, I want to ask something:

You make this happen, do you plead yourself guilty?

-- Elaborate, you're on the right track.

~ The dick in you has spoken.

Comet was now the only thing that existed. Font Real, Del Eec, and Allin are not here, I swear.

# I am Comet and I have seen.

El Cometa volador conocio al gato un dia de esos y vio en el lo que se deberia saber. Por que no se quedaron los dias que contenian a Font Real y a los demas? El gato tambien puede hablar.

* Yo no se.

El gato no sabia. Pero el gato tenia cuerpo y no le deberia importar esa pregunta.

# I am Comet and I knew you.
