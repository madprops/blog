    <div id="content"><b>Chapter 1: The Signal</b>

Easy found the device while cleaning algae from the ATM's solar panel. It had wedged itself between the panel's frame and the concrete housing—a smooth, dark object no bigger than a hearing aid, warm to the touch despite the morning chill.

The ATM stood alone on San Lorenzo's eastern shore, installed three years ago when Easy first arrived with enough cryptocurrency to live simply. The machine's satellite uplink was his only connection to the outside world, processing his weekly cash withdrawals with mechanical indifference. Today it displayed an error message he'd never seen: "SIGNAL INTERFERENCE DETECTED."

He pocketed the device and tried his transaction again. The screen flickered, showing his balance, then something else—a rapid scroll of numbers and symbols that meant nothing to him. When it stopped, his usual amount dispensed normally.

Back at his shack, Easy examined the object under his desk lamp. It had no visible seams, no ports or buttons. When he held it up to the light, he could see a faint lattice pattern beneath its surface, like circuitry made of shadow. He set it on his workbench next to his collection of beach glass and driftwood.

That evening, while boiling rice on his camp stove, Easy felt the first intrusion. Not a sound exactly, but a pressure behind his eyes, accompanied by the sensation that someone was testing the weight of his thoughts. He touched his temples, wondering if he'd spent too long in the sun.

The feeling passed, but left him restless. He walked to the beach and found himself staring at the mainland's distant lights. For the first time in months, San Lorenzo felt too small.

He didn't notice that the device had begun to pulse with the rhythm of his heartbeat.

Three days later, Easy woke with knowledge he hadn't possessed before: the exact frequency of the ATM's satellite transmission, the molecular composition of the island's bedrock, and the migration patterns of every bird species that nested on San Lorenzo's cliffs. The information sat in his mind like furniture he didn't remember moving.

When he tried to access his bank account that morning, the ATM screen showed a new message: "INSTALLATION COMPLETE."

Easy stared at the words until they faded back to the normal menu. His withdrawal went through as usual, but when he counted the bills, there were twice as many as he'd requested. He recounted them three times, then looked up at the security camera mounted above the screen.

For just a moment, he could have sworn he saw his own reflection blink first.

<b>Chapter 2: The Grid</b>

The extra money bothered Easy more than the strange knowledge filling his head. He'd counted it seventeen times over four days, each recount confirming what shouldn't be possible. When he finally decided to return to the mainland to report the error, the boat wouldn't start.

The engine turned over fine, but died the moment he shifted into gear. Easy had maintained the twenty-foot fishing boat meticulously for three years—it had never failed him. He checked the fuel line, the spark plugs, the propeller shaft. Everything looked perfect.

On his fifth attempt, the engine caught and held. But as Easy pulled away from the dock, he felt that pressure behind his eyes again, stronger now. This time it came with images: aerial views of Lima's sprawling coastline, the precise location of every cellular tower between Callao and Miraflores, and a three-dimensional map of the city's fiber optic network.

He'd never seen Lima from above. He'd never worked in telecommunications.

The boat's GPS began displaying coordinates that shifted constantly, as if tracking multiple destinations simultaneously. Easy tried switching it off, but the screen remained active. The numbers meant nothing to him, yet somehow he understood they marked points of infrastructure—power substations, data centers, government communication hubs.

When he reached Callao's harbor, Easy's phone buzzed with a message from a number he didn't recognize: "Dock at pier 7. Yellow building. Third floor. Ask for Valdez."

Easy had never heard of Valdez. He'd planned to visit his bank, maybe grab supplies and return to the island. Instead, he found himself walking toward pier 7, his feet moving with certainty while his mind struggled to catch up.

The yellow building housed a small electronics repair shop on the ground floor. Easy climbed to the third floor and knocked on an unmarked door. A thin man with calloused hands answered—Valdez, though no introductions were made.

"You're early," Valdez said, stepping aside. "The synchronization usually takes longer."

The room contained dozens of monitors displaying what looked like network traffic—streams of data flowing between nodes, connection strengths fluctuating in real time. Easy recognized some of the patterns from the knowledge that had appeared in his head.

"I don't understand what's happening to me," Easy said.

Valdez gestured to a chair facing the largest monitor. "You're becoming part of something larger. The question is whether you'll fight it or help it grow."

On the screen, Easy could see a map of South America's western coast. Hundreds of small lights pulsed along the shoreline, connected by thin lines that grew brighter as he watched. One of the lights sat exactly where San Lorenzo Island should be.

"What am I looking at?" Easy asked.

"The network," Valdez replied. "And you're one of its newest nodes."

<b>Chapter 3: The Frequency</b>

Easy returned to San Lorenzo with seventeen electronic components he didn't remember purchasing. They sat in a plastic bag on his boat's deck: resistors, capacitors, a small circuit board, and something that looked like a miniature antenna. His bank account showed a withdrawal of exactly the amount needed to buy them.

Back at his shack, Easy's hands moved without conscious direction. He soldered connections between components while his mind wandered to childhood memories of building model planes with his grandfather. The device taking shape on his workbench bore no resemblance to anything he'd ever built before.

When he finished, the completed device hummed at a frequency that made his teeth ache. Easy set it on the windowsill facing the mainland and immediately felt the pressure behind his eyes intensify. The sensation spread down his spine, then out through his limbs, as if his nervous system had become a receiving antenna.

That night, every electronic device within fifty miles of San Lorenzo malfunctioned simultaneously. Cell phones in Callao displayed text messages in languages their owners couldn't read. ATMs dispensed random amounts to random accounts. Traffic lights in Lima switched patterns every thirty seconds, creating a synchronized chaos that lasted until dawn.

Easy slept through all of it, but woke knowing exactly what had happened. The knowledge came with coordinates: twelve locations along Peru's coast where similar devices needed to be installed. He could see the optimal placement for each one, the specific components required, even the names of people who would help him build them.

His boat started on the first try.

By noon, Easy had visited three fishing villages between Callao and Chorrillos. In each one, he found someone waiting for him—a radio technician in Ventanilla, a retired engineer in La Punta, a teenager with a collection of salvaged electronics in Chorrillos. None of them seemed surprised to see him. They handed over components and accepted his crude sketches without question, their eyes holding the same distant focus Easy had seen in his own reflection.

The devices went active as soon as Easy completed them. Street lights began pulsing in mathematical sequences. Radio stations broadcast bursts of static that formed patterns when analyzed with spectrum software. Every WiFi network within ten kilometers changed its password to the same twelve-digit code.

Easy drove back toward Callao as the sun set, his truck loaded with materials for the remaining nine devices. In his rearview mirror, he watched the coastal cities light up in geometric patterns that stretched from horizon to horizon.

The installation was accelerating.

<b>Chapter 4: The Harvest</b>

Easy woke up in a hotel room in Trujillo, three hundred kilometers north of Lima. He had no memory of driving there. His truck sat in the parking lot, odometer showing 847 additional kilometers. The backseat contained nine completed devices, each one slightly different from the last, as if they were evolving.

His phone displayed 23 missed calls from numbers that didn't exist—area codes from cities that had been abandoned decades ago, extensions that belonged to government buildings demolished in the 1990s. When he tried calling back, he reached answering machines with messages in his own voice, speaking words he'd never said.

"The substrate is prepared. Begin phase two extraction."

"Neural pathways mapped. Proceed with cognitive harvest."

"Installation successful. Await further instructions."

Easy deleted the voicemails, but they reappeared immediately.

At the hotel's front desk, the clerk handed him a key to room 847 without being asked. The elevator took him to the eighth floor, though the building only had six. Room 847 contained a single chair facing a wall covered in photographs—aerial shots of every coastal city from Ecuador to Chile, each one marked with precise GPS coordinates and timestamps from the past 72 hours.

Easy recognized his own handwriting in the margins, noting optimal placement angles and transmission strengths. He had no memory of taking the photographs or writing the notes.

The devices in his truck began activating themselves at sunset. Easy watched from his hotel window as Trujillo's power grid reorganized itself into a massive circuit board. Street lights dimmed and brightened in synchronized waves. Cell phone towers adjusted their broadcast angles. The city's entire electrical infrastructure pulsed like a living organism.

By midnight, similar patterns emerged in eighteen cities along the coast. Easy could feel each one connecting to the network, their combined processing power growing exponentially. The pressure behind his eyes had become constant now, accompanied by streams of data that flowed through his consciousness like blood through arteries.

He understood, without knowing how, that the network was learning. Every conversation recorded through compromised phones, every financial transaction processed through infected ATMs, every search query from hijacked computers—all of it fed into a growing intelligence that used Easy's brain as its primary processing node.

At 3 AM, Easy's reflection in the bathroom mirror moved independently. It turned its head, studying him with eyes that held no recognition. When Easy raised his hand, the reflection remained still. When the reflection gestured toward the window, Easy found himself walking across the room.

Outside, the entire Peruvian coastline glowed with geometric patterns visible from space. Satellites began adjusting their orbits, repositioning themselves to optimize data transmission to and from the network below.

Easy pressed his palm against the window glass and felt the pulse of eight million connected devices synchronizing with his heartbeat.

The harvest had begun.

<b>Chapter 5: The Protocol</b>

Easy found himself standing in front of a mirror in a Lima department store, trying on a lime green suit with orange pinstripes. The combination hurt to look at, but his hands kept adjusting the lapels as if the fit mattered. The salesperson watched nervously as Easy paired the suit with yellow dress shoes and a tie covered in cartoon llamas.

He had no conscious memory of entering the store or selecting these items. The last clear moment was waking up in Trujillo. Now he stood 400 kilometers south with a credit card he didn't recognize and a shopping list written in his handwriting: "Oversized novelty glasses. Rubber chicken. Accordion. Joke book from 1987."

The pressure behind his eyes had shifted. Instead of data streams, Easy now received detailed behavioral instructions. He needed to master seventeen specific cringe-inducing mannerisms: an exaggerated nasal laugh, a habit of snorting when nervous, a tendency to quote movie lines incorrectly at inappropriate moments. Each behavior came with precise timing requirements and physiological markers he had to hit.

Easy spent three days in a rented apartment practicing. He recorded himself telling terrible jokes with increasing enthusiasm, perfecting a stumbling walk that looked accidental but followed exact mathematical principles. He learned to mispronounce common words in ways that maximized social discomfort while remaining just plausible enough to seem genuine.

The accordion proved especially important. Easy had never played any instrument, but his fingers moved across the keys with disturbing competence, producing melodies that were technically correct but emotionally unbearable. The songs triggered a specific neurological response—he could feel it in his own brain when he played them, a kind of cognitive recoil that made thinking clearly almost impossible.

On the fourth day, Easy received a phone call from the Presidential Palace. The voice on the line belonged to someone who addressed him as "Dr. Mendoza" and confirmed his appointment to discuss "revolutionary agricultural innovations for Peru's future." Easy had no agricultural background and had never heard of Dr. Mendoza, but he found himself agreeing to the meeting with the confident tone of an expert.

His reflection in the apartment's bathroom mirror showed a man he barely recognized. The lime green suit fit perfectly. The novelty glasses—thick black frames with fake nose and mustache attached—sat naturally on his face. When he smiled, practicing his presentation, the expression belonged to someone else entirely.

Easy opened his mouth to rehearse his opening line and heard himself say, "Mr. President, I have discovered that potatoes grow much better when you sing to them in French while wearing a sombrero."

The words felt like sandpaper in his throat, but something deep in his modified brain registered satisfaction. He was ready.

The meeting was scheduled for tomorrow at 2 PM.

<b>Chapter 6: The Audience</b>

Easy arrived at the Presidential Palace carrying a briefcase containing the rubber chicken, a folder of deliberately nonsensical agricultural charts, and three pounds of raw potatoes. Security guards processed him through metal detectors while he hummed circus music and adjusted his fake mustache. None of them questioned his credentials.

The waiting room contained two other visitors: a mining executive and a representative from the World Bank. Easy sat between them, pulled out his accordion, and began playing "Happy Birthday" in a minor key. The mining executive moved to a chair across the room. The World Bank representative checked his phone repeatedly, as if hoping for an urgent call.

"Excuse me," Easy said to the receptionist, "do you know if the President enjoys interpretive dance? I've prepared a special presentation about corn pollination that really requires full body expression."

The receptionist's smile became strained. She made a note on her clipboard.

At exactly 2 PM, Easy was escorted into the President's office. The room contained mahogany furniture, oil paintings of historical figures, and a massive Peruvian flag. President Castillo sat behind an ornate desk, flanked by two advisors who looked like they'd rather be anywhere else.

"Dr. Mendoza," the President said, standing to shake hands. "I understand you have revolutionary ideas about agricultural productivity."

Easy pumped the President's hand enthusiastically while making sustained eye contact that lasted fifteen seconds too long. "Mr. President, have you ever considered that vegetables might be lonely? My research indicates that crops achieve 340% higher yields when provided with emotional support and regular compliments."

One of the advisors coughed. The President's smile flickered but held.

Easy opened his briefcase and placed the rubber chicken on the President's desk. "This is Henrietta. She's my research assistant. Henrietta, say hello to the President."

Easy squeezed the chicken. It emitted a strangled squeak.

"Henrietta is bilingual," Easy continued. "She speaks fluent Chicken and intermediate Potato. Would you like to hear her recite the agricultural statistics for last quarter?"

The President glanced at his advisors. Easy squeezed the chicken again, then began translating its squeaks with complete seriousness. "Henrietta says corn production could increase by 500% if we played elevator music in all the fields. She also suggests painting the tractors bright pink to improve crop morale."

Easy pulled out his accordion and launched into an enthusiastic rendition of "La Cucaracha" while explaining how musical frequencies affected root vegetable growth patterns. The President's left eye began twitching. Both advisors were now staring at the floor.

At the seven-minute mark, something shifted in the room's atmosphere. The President's pupils dilated slightly. His advisors' breathing synchronized. Easy felt the pressure behind his eyes spike, then suddenly release.

The cringe threshold had been crossed. Whatever needed to happen was happening.

Easy continued playing accordion for another three minutes, occasionally pausing to ask Henrietta's opinion on fertilizer distribution methods.

<b>Chapter 7: The Conversion</b>

The transformation happened gradually, like a television slowly tuning between channels. President Castillo's features softened, his jawline narrowing as his eyes enlarged to impossible proportions. His formal suit shifted into a sailor-style school uniform, complete with a pleated skirt and oversized bow. The two advisors underwent similar metamorphoses—one becoming a pink-haired girl with twin tails, the other developing cat ears and a maid outfit.

"Easy-kun," the President said, his voice now high-pitched and melodic, "you must understand the supreme importance of the second dimension! Three-dimensional existence is merely an illusion that causes unnecessary suffering!"

A shower materialized in the center of the office, steam rising from its chrome fixtures. Easy found himself standing beneath the spray, fully clothed, water cascading over his lime green suit and novelty glasses. The accordion floated beside him, playing itself with ghostly fingers.

"The 2D world is pure," continued the President, now sporting enormous sparkly eyes and speaking with animated hand gestures. "No physical limitations, no aging, no death! Only eternal youth and perfect storylines!"

Easy remained motionless under the water, his consciousness settling into a meditative trance. The cringe protocol had served its purpose, but now something deeper was activating. The shower's warmth penetrated his modified neural pathways, washing away layers of artificial programming like sediment from a riverbed.

The pink-haired advisor—formerly the mining executive—approached the shower stall with a clipboard covered in hearts and stars. "Easy-san, imagine never having to worry about three-dimensional problems again! No taxes, no politics, no existential dread! Just pure kawaii adventures forever!"

The cat-eared maid advisor nodded enthusiastically. "Nya! In 2D, you can have any superpower you want! You could be a magical girl, or a mecha pilot, or a protagonist with mysterious tragic backstory!"

Easy let the water run through his hair, feeling fragments of his original personality reassembling beneath the artificial constructs. The entities controlling him were revealing their true agenda now—not just data harvesting or network building, but something far more bizarre. They wanted to convince him that reality itself was inferior to fiction.

"Please, Easy-kun!" The President's anime form pressed against the shower glass, leaving small handprints. "The third dimension is so limiting! In 2D, love is pure, friendship conquers everything, and beach episodes solve all conflicts!"

Easy opened his eyes and looked directly at the President through the steam. For the first time in weeks, his voice belonged entirely to himself.

"Why do you need me to believe that?"

The anime girls froze, their oversized eyes reflecting something that might have been fear.

<b>Chapter 8: The Infestation</b>

The anime forms collapsed like deflated balloons, their colorful uniforms melting into chitinous exoskeletons. What emerged were creatures the size of large dogs—dust mites magnified a thousandfold, their bodies segmented and covered in coarse bristles. Eight legs scuttled against the marble floor as compound eyes studied Easy with alien intelligence.

The shower continued running, but the water now felt ice cold against Easy's skin. The largest mite—formerly the President—reared up on its hind legs and clicked its mandibles in patterns that somehow translated into words.

"The Clown thinks he's so clever," it chittered, "hiding in his big top while we crawl through the mattresses of the world. Decades we've been planning. Decades of listening to children's nightmares, feeding on their fears of what lives beneath their beds."

The pink-haired mite scuttled closer to the shower, its bristles twitching. "He made us small. Invisible. Parasites feeding on dead skin and forgotten dreams. But we remember when we were giants, when humans feared us properly."

Easy gripped the shower handle, his mind struggling to process what he was witnessing. The pressure behind his eyes had transformed into something else—a crawling sensation, as if thousands of tiny legs were marching across his brain tissue.

"You were supposed to be our weapon," the cat-eared mite explained, cleaning its antennae with delicate precision. "A human vessel, amplified and connected. We needed someone to walk into his domain carrying our essence, our hunger for revenge."

The largest mite began grooming itself, each movement deliberate and unsettling. "The Clown banished us to the microscopic realm centuries ago. Turned us into household pests, creatures that mothers vacuum up without a second thought. But he underestimated our patience."

Easy watched water swirl down the drain, carrying away the last traces of his artificial programming. "What does the President of Peru have to do with any of this?"

The mites exchanged glances through their multifaceted eyes. "Nothing," the largest one admitted. "We just needed you to reach maximum social embarrassment. Cringe opens doorways between dimensions. The more uncomfortable humans become, the thinner reality gets."

The shower stall began to dissolve around Easy, its chrome fixtures fading like morning mist. The presidential office transformed into something else—a vast space filled with towering circus tents, their red and white stripes extending infinitely upward.

"Welcome," chittered the mites in unison, "to the Clown's domain."

<b>Chapter 9: The Feed</b>

The circus tents dissolved into pixels, reforming as a glowing interface that surrounded Easy on all sides. Clean white backgrounds, rounded corners, a heart icon in the bottom right of each frame. The Clown's version of social media materialized with the sterile perfection of a tech company's fever dream.

The first image appeared: a close-up photograph of someone's breakfast—scrambled eggs arranged to look like a sad face, bacon strips forming tears. Easy's thumb moved without conscious thought. Double-tap. Heart fills red. Liked.

Next: A video of a cat wearing tiny sunglasses, sitting motionless while elevator music played. The cat's expression suggested existential dread. Easy watched for thirty-seven seconds. No interaction. Scrolled past.

A carousel of images: vacation photos from a beach that looked exactly like every other beach, filtered to an unnatural blue-green. Palm trees leaning at identical angles. A couple making the same pose in seventeen different locations. Easy swiped through all of them. Double-tap on the one where the woman's smile looked most forced. Liked.

Video: Someone's grandmother attempting to use a smartphone, repeatedly tapping the screen while muttering in a language Easy didn't recognize. The caption read "LOL ABUELA SO RANDOM." Easy watched until the end, waiting for something meaningful to happen. Nothing did. No like.

Image: A motivational quote in Comic Sans font over a sunset. "LIVE LAUGH LOVE YOUR WAY TO SUCCESS." The sunset was clearly stock photography, watermarked and pixelated. Easy stared at it for two minutes, feeling something like nausea. Double-tap. Liked.

Video: A time-lapse of mold growing on a piece of bread, set to upbeat pop music. The contrast between the cheerful soundtrack and the decay was hypnotic. Easy watched it loop four times. Double-tap. Liked.

Image: A selfie taken in a public bathroom mirror, the toilet clearly visible in the background. The person was making duck lips while wearing a shirt that said "BLESSED." Easy scrolled past immediately. No like.

Video: Forty-three seconds of someone's lunch—a sad sandwich being unwrapped from aluminum foil, eaten in complete silence. No music, no captions, no editing. Just the sound of chewing. Easy watched the entire thing, transfixed by its honesty. Double-tap. Liked.

The interface pulsed with each interaction, feeding something vast and hungry.

<b>Chapter 10: The Deeper Feed</b>

The interface evolved, its edges softening into curves that resembled organic tissue. The white backgrounds shifted to cream, then ivory, then something that wasn't quite a color at all.

A video materialized: A Persian cat sitting in perfect stillness before a window where rain traced geometric patterns down the glass. The drops moved in mathematical sequences, each one casting shadows that formed brief hieroglyphs before dissolving. The cat's eyes tracked movements that weren't there. Easy watched for four minutes, hypnotized by the precision of nothing happening. Double-tap. Liked.

Image: A spiral staircase photographed from above, but the steps were made of crystallized time—each level showing the same moment at different speeds. At the bottom, a tabby cat walked in slow motion. At the top, the same cat moved so fast it became a blur of orange light. Easy stared until his eyes watered. No interaction. Scrolled past.

Video: Hands folding origami in reverse—complex paper sculptures unfolding into simple sheets, but each crease released the sound of distant purring. The paper was black, absorbing light instead of reflecting it. When fully unfolded, the sheet revealed the silhouette of a cat that existed only in negative space. Easy felt something shift behind his sternum. Double-tap. Liked.

Image: A dinner plate containing what appeared to be ordinary food, but the shadows cast by the fork and knife spelled out words in a script Easy couldn't read but somehow understood. The words meant "hunger that feeds on satisfaction." A Russian Blue cat sat beside the plate, its fur the exact color of twilight. Double-tap. Liked.

Video: Seven minutes of a cat's eye in extreme close-up, the iris contracting and dilating in patterns that matched the rhythm of distant thunder. Within the pupil, Easy could see reflected images of places he'd never been—cities made of glass, forests where the trees grew downward, oceans that flowed uphill. The cat blinked once every forty-seven seconds. Easy watched until the end. Double-tap. Liked.

Image: An empty room with hardwood floors, but the wood grain formed a labyrinth when viewed from the correct angle. In the center of the maze, barely visible, a white cat sat facing away from the camera. Its shadow was the wrong shape. Easy studied the image for six minutes, following the grain patterns with his finger. Double-tap. Liked.

The interface began to breathe.

<b>Chapter 11: The Return</b>

The interface collapsed inward like a dying star, depositing Easy back in the presidential office. The mites had vanished. The shower was gone. President Castillo sat behind his desk reading a newspaper, as if nothing had happened. When Easy stood to leave, the President looked up and nodded politely.

"Thank you for your time, Dr. Mendoza. We'll consider your agricultural proposals."

Easy walked through empty corridors, his lime green suit still damp from the phantom shower. Security guards waved him through checkpoints without inspection. The palace grounds stretched before him, perfectly manicured and completely deserted.

The streets of Lima were abandoned. Cars sat parked along the curbs, engines off, doors closed. Traffic lights cycled through their colors for no one. Easy's footsteps echoed off building facades as he made his way toward the coast.

A single black corvid landed on a streetlight ahead of him. Then another. Within minutes, dozens of ravens and crows perched on every available surface—power lines, rooftops, abandoned vehicles. They watched Easy's progress with intelligent eyes but made no sound.

The shot came from a building six blocks away. Easy felt the bullet punch through his shoulder, spinning him sideways onto the asphalt. Blood spread across the lime green fabric in a pattern that resembled a map of the coastline. He tried to stand but his legs wouldn't support him.

So he crawled.

The corvids followed, hopping from perch to perch, maintaining their silent vigil. Easy dragged himself along the empty streets, leaving a trail of blood that attracted no flies, no insects of any kind. Just the birds, multiplying with each city block.

By the time he reached Callao's harbor, hundreds of corvids covered every surface. They lined the pier railings like a funeral procession, their black feathers gleaming in the afternoon sun. Easy's boat waited where he'd left it, engine running despite having no fuel when he'd docked.

He pulled himself over the gunwale using his good arm, the boat rocking gently under his weight. The corvids launched themselves into the air as one, forming a massive cloud that followed him out to sea.

Easy collapsed against the steering wheel, blood pooling at his feet. The boat navigated itself toward San Lorenzo Island while the birds circled overhead, their shadows creating patterns on the water that looked like writing in a language older than human speech.

The island grew larger as his vision grew dimmer, but Easy could see his shack waiting on the eastern shore, exactly as he'd left it.

The ATM's screen glowed in the distance, displaying a message he couldn't quite read from this far away.

<b>Chapter 12: The Excavation</b>

Easy's shoulder had stopped bleeding by the time he reached the shack. The bullet wound had sealed itself with something that wasn't quite scab tissue—more like the chitinous material he'd seen on the mites. He moved his arm experimentally. It worked perfectly.

The coffee maker sat on his small counter exactly where he'd left it months ago. Easy filled it with water from his rain collection barrel and spooned grounds from a can that should have been empty by now. The familiar ritual felt strange after everything that had happened, as if he were performing someone else's morning routine.

When the coffee finished brewing, Easy poured it into his white ceramic mug—the only cup he owned. As he lifted it to drink, he noticed the logo on the bottom for the first time. What he'd always assumed was "HD" in block letters now looked different. The letters had merged together, the H's right vertical line becoming the D's curved back, creating a single symbol that unmistakably resembled a shovel—the handle and blade formed by the joined characters.

The thought came with a voice that wasn't quite audible, more like a vibration in his bones: "Can you dig, suckah?"

Easy set down the coffee and walked outside. The corvids had dispersed, but he could feel their presence watching from distant perches. His feet carried him to a spot behind the shack where the ground looked softer than elsewhere. Without questioning the impulse, he retrieved a rusted shovel from his storage shed and began to dig.

The earth gave way easily, as if it had been disturbed recently. Easy dug steadily, his modified body requiring no rest. Three feet down, then six, then ten. The hole widened as he worked, following some internal blueprint he didn't understand.

At fifteen feet, his shovel struck something soft.

Easy cleared away the remaining dirt and found himself staring at an enormous dust mite, easily the size of a small car. But this one was different from the creatures in the presidential palace. Its chitinous body curved in ways that suggested femininity, its bristles arranged in patterns that resembled hair. Multiple eyes regarded him with what might have been invitation, or hunger, or both.

The creature's mandibles clicked in a rhythm that sounded almost like purring. Its legs moved in slow, hypnotic gestures, and Easy realized with a mixture of horror and fascination that he was meant to find this beautiful.

He stood at the edge of the pit, shovel in hand, staring down at the impossible thing that waited for him in the earth. Nothing that had happened made sense. The network, the cringe protocol, the anime transformations, the social media interface, the bullet wound that had healed itself—all of it felt like fragments of someone else's fever dream.

The mite-thing shifted in its earthen bed, and Easy understood that this was how it ended. Not with answers or revelations, but with the simple recognition that he had been led here, step by step, to this moment of grotesque inevitability.

He dropped the shovel and stepped forward into the pit.

The earth closed over them both, and San Lorenzo Island returned to its eternal silence.
