    <div id="content">My purpose in the following text is to transmit a way of thinking that
can lead you to living life more pleasantly, and might help me as well
if I need to be reminded of this.

# Background knowledge

The existence I know has always been inside this universe. All the
things have been here, new things slowly get invented and introduced,
but everything makes sense. So it's important to be taught and exposed
to things that exist, and have discussions about them, because that is
what you are going to be playing with. This becomes especially important
at some point when you realize people around you don't know much.

# Life is very long

Existence is incredibly long and you will mostly act towards a noble
goal for many years, with lots of physical experience but no refined
mental world to live in yet. This goal is either survival or moving
towards a promise. The energy will build many things along the way. This
is you, things are happening to you, through you, building yourself,
experiencing higher level decisions. The things you get to use get built
by hand in a time that is very long and short and unquestioned. This is
you having fun and pain.

# Life becomes mental

Your intelligence gets upgraded, you get new perspectives through the
ability of interpretation. At this point life becomes very slow and many
things happen through your actions, and you get to experience this
personally. Modes of life change quickly, ranging from absolutely
deranged in a state of survival to completely care free. You ditch old
paradigms that motivated you to do insane and random things out of
instinct and imagination, to not caring about your fate anymore. You
experience history, travel, war, creation, friendship, views, magic,
science, economy, survival, luck, characters, time, in reality, because
you can see the subtle differences. At this point the world you are in
physically becomes very small, but a lot of different things exist
around you, and that is what will give you a lot of your meaning.

# Movement

You are bound to achieve travels, and heights, and depths, with your own
two legs, which might be the only real physical vehicle you got. This is
movement through time and space. Another agent of change and provider of
views. The view is part of what gives you meaning. In your head you move
in other creative ways out of narrative and technology.

# Riding

During your energy phase you got inside many vehicles and rooms. These
connections remain. You are still there.

# What you see

You understand that moments can represent a lot of those years of
building where you didn't have a full mind yet and thus you get more
careful with what you do. You understand that there has been a
conversation going on for a long time. You realize you were never told
that everyone was playing a game, you were not invited, but now you can
play. The world becomes silent and hostile in places that were once
vibrant. Things changed. But everything is very interesting.

# Freedom

Mental and emotional freedom come through the realization of several
things. You realize that you've been defending yourself against
established enemies when anything can be your enemy, or your friend,
depending on current configurations. You realize you can actually
acknowledge a momentary pain or conflict, because life is very long and
your energy is very varied, meaning change will happen to you and
others. The ones wanting to hurt you might have been hurt by you, the
ones wanting to live at your expense might have paid for your living,
there are no better or worse. Everything works out while you continue
existing because good fortune is at the reach of anybody and arrives in
many forms, short or long, well known or more creative, as long as
there's always something that keeps people playing. Fortune changes form
so you you don't always have the same tricks or advantages, it makes
things interesting, this is needed to have a fun long existence.
Knowledge and skills determine what you get and for how long, but change
is still inevitable. Bad decisions hurt yourself, foul play hurts others
but you will know what you did, and this leaks. Shame has to lose its
power over you, don't be afraid to live a varied and crazy life; laugh
about what you do instead of trying to predict how observers judge you.

# Real life?

Great potential and change in the sudden long life you get, but do you
get to experience first hand everything you are creating? Does it end
when you filled up the universe with your inventions and entropy
realizing you paved the way for yourself, was that the little life you
got? Maybe. But I'm expecting more.
