*FADE IN:*

*INT. CORNO FAST FOOD - DAY*

The fluorescent lights buzz like dying insects. DEREK (22, hollow-eyed, grease-stained uniform) stands behind the register, his name tag crooked. The digital clock reads 6:00 AM. Six hours to survive.

*His POV: The restaurant transforms. The order screen becomes a glowing séance board. The kitchen equipment breathes like sleeping monsters.*

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*They're coming. I can feel them stirring in the ether, hungry for judgment.*

*DING!* First order appears on screen: "Double Corno Deluxe, no pickles."

*In Derek's mind: A GHOSTLY CUSTOMER materializes, translucent and demanding, floating three feet off the ground.*

<b>GHOST CUSTOMER</b>
*(voice echoing from another dimension)*
Where... are... my... pickles...?

Derek's hands shake as he punches buttons. The ghost hovers, waiting. Other spectral figures begin forming in line behind it - a PHANTOM SOCCER MOM tapping her ethereal foot, a WRAITH in a business suit checking his non-existent watch.

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*The Pickle Banshee. First of the day. If I mess this up, she'll drag me to the underworld of one-star reviews.*

He assembles the burger with surgical precision. Each ingredient placement feels like defusing a bomb.

*WHOOSH* - the order disappears into the kitchen void.

The ghost customer's eyes glow green as she raises her thumb. Derek holds his breath.

*THUMBS UP*

The specter dissolves with what might have been a smile.

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*Survived the first haunting. Only 5 hours and 58 minutes until I can shed this mortal coil... or at least this mortal shift.*

*DING! DING! DING!*

Three more orders flood the screen. Derek's pupils dilate as his haunted cafeteria fills with demanding spirits.

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*The séance has begun.*

*CUT TO BLACK*

<b>END CHAPTER 1</b>

---

<b>CHAPTER 2: THE TORMENT</b>

*INT. CORNO FAST FOOD - DAY (6:47 AM)*

*Reality: A mundane line of CUSTOMERS, faces buried in phones, thumbs hovering over the Corno app like vultures. Their screens glow with Derek's employee profile - 2.3 stars, dropping.*

*Derek's POV: The restaurant has become a medieval torture chamber. The customers are now DEMONIC ENTITIES with burning eyes and clawed fingers.*

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*The morning rush. When the demons feast.*

*DING!* "Triple Bacon Blasphemy, extra hell sauce, make it PERFECT."

*In Derek's mind: A HORNED BEAST pounds the counter with meaty fists. Its breath smells like expired mayo.*

<b>DEMON CUSTOMER</b>
*(voice like grinding metal)*
I can taste your fear, burger boy. One mistake and your soul is MINE.

Derek's hands tremble as he navigates the burger assembly. First patty - sizzling on the grill like screaming souls. The bacon strips writhe like tiny serpents.

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*The Triple Bacon Blasphemy. Three beef patties, each one a test of my mortality. Stack them wrong and the app gods rain down their digital wrath.*

*Reality check: A BORED TEENAGER at table 3 casually hovers his thumb over the red dislike button, not even looking up from TikTok.*

Back in Derek's hell-vision: The demon customer multiplies into THREE IDENTICAL TORMENTORS, each more hideous than the last.

<b>DEMON CHORUS</b>
Where's our sauce? WHERE'S OUR SAUCE?!

Derek squirts the hell sauce - in reality, just ketchup - but in his mind it's liquid fire that burns his fingers. He assembles the burger like performing surgery on a live grenade.

The final bun placement. The moment of truth.

*WHOOSH* - order complete.

The demons lean in, their eyes like smartphone screens. Derek watches in slow motion as three clawed thumbs hover in the air...

*THUMBS DOWN*

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*No. NO. Not the bacon blasphemy. Not like this-*

Derek clutches his chest. Lightning pain shoots through his uniform. The restaurant spins. He tastes copper and defeat.

But then... he's still standing.

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*Wait. I'm... alive? How am I still-*

*DING! DING! DING! DING!*

Four more orders flood in. The demons multiply, their laughter echoing off the fryer oil.

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*They're not here to kill me quickly. They want to watch me suffer first.*

*FADE TO RED*

<b>END CHAPTER 2</b>

---

<b>CHAPTER 3: THE AWAKENING</b>

*INT. CORNO FAST FOOD - DAY (12:00 PM)*

The digital clock strikes noon. Derek has survived. A strange warmth spreads through his chest.

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*Six hours. I made it through the gauntlet of grease and judgment.*

*EVOLUTION 1: PATTERN RECOGNITION*

Suddenly, Derek's vision sharpens. The chaotic demon horde transforms - he can see PATTERNS in their behavior. The soccer mom phantom always orders at 12:03. The business wraith needs his order in exactly 90 seconds or he thumbs down.

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*Wait... they're not random tormentors. They're... predictable. Like NPCs in a game.*

*Reality: The same customers cycle through daily, ordering the same items, following the same routines.*

*DING!* "Corno Classic, no onions."

Derek doesn't panic. He KNOWS this order. The Onion Banshee - she appears every day at 12:04, tests his memory, then vanishes satisfied.

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*You want your classic? I'll give you a CLASSIC.*

He assembles the burger with newfound confidence. Each movement precise, almost choreographed. The Onion Banshee watches, surprised by his composure.

*THUMBS UP*

*EVOLUTION 2: ENHANCED REFLEXES*

Derek's hands move faster now. Orders blur past - he's anticipating ingredients before the screen updates. The demonic customers look... smaller somehow.

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*I'm not their victim anymore. I'm... learning their language.*

*DING! DING! DING!*

Triple order rush. In the old reality, this meant certain death. Now Derek sees it as a COMBO CHAIN. His fingers dance across the register like a pianist.

*Reality: Customers look up from their phones, mildly impressed by the speed.*

*EVOLUTION 3: MIND READING*

Derek stares at the Horned Beast demon. Suddenly, he can sense its TRUE desire - not torture, but... validation? The beast just wants its order acknowledged, respected.

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*You're not evil. You're just... hangry.*

Derek makes eye contact with the beast as he crafts its Triple Bacon Blasphemy. He adds a small flourish - an extra pickle arranged in a smiley face.

The demon's expression softens. For a moment, it looks almost... human.

*THUMBS UP + FIVE STAR REVIEW*

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*The game isn't about survival. It's about understanding. And now that I understand...*

Derek looks around his transformed restaurant. The demons are still there, but they're watching him with something new in their eyes.

Respect.

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*...I think I'm ready to play on hard mode.*

*FADE TO GOLD*

<b>END CHAPTER 3</b>

---

<b>CHAPTER 4: THE METAMORPHOSIS</b>

*INT. CORNO FAST FOOD - NIGHT (11:00 PM)*

The fluorescent lights flicker differently at night. Derek's second shift begins. His reflection in the fryer hood shows something... changed.

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*Night shift. When the real demons come out to play.*

*EVOLUTION 4: PREDATOR SKIN*

Derek's arms ripple. Gray fur sprouts along his forearms, coarse and wild. His fingernails sharpen into claws - perfect for gripping burger buns, terrible for explaining to management.

*Reality: MANAGER STEVE (40s, dead inside) waddles over, clipboard in hand.*

<b>MANAGER STEVE</b>
Derek, your customer ratings are... weird. Too high. Corporate's asking questions.

*Derek's POV: Steve transforms into a BLOATED TOAD DEMON, dripping bureaucratic slime.*

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*The Toad King. Middle management incarnate. He fears my evolution.*

Derek's new wolf-eyes lock onto Steve. He can smell the manager's fear-sweat mixed with energy drink and disappointment.

<b>DEREK</b>
*(voice slightly growling)*
Just doing my job, Steve.

*EVOLUTION 5: AQUATIC ADAPTATION*

Gills flutter open along Derek's neck as the night air grows thick with fryer steam. He can breathe the grease-laden atmosphere like water. His movements become fluid, predatory.

*DING!* "Midnight Munchie Massacre - 12 burgers, extra everything."

*Derek's POV: A PACK OF SHADOW WOLVES surrounds the counter, their hunger radiating like heat.*

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*The midnight pack. They hunt in groups, coordinate their thumbs-down attacks. But tonight... tonight I hunt them.*

*EVOLUTION 6: UNGULATE POWER*

Derek's feet transform inside his work shoes - hooves now, giving him supernatural stability. He pounds across the kitchen floor like thunder, assembling burgers with the fury of a stampeding beast.

But this isn't just food preparation anymore. This is WAR CRAFT.

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*They want their massacre meal? I'll give them something to remember.*

Derek begins his nefarious plan. Each burger becomes a weapon. He infuses the meat with his newfound predator essence - not poison, but DOMINANCE. Alpha energy baked into every bite.

The pickles arranged like runic symbols. The sauce applied in mystical patterns. Each burger a small totem of power.

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*You've been feeding on my fear for too long. Time to return the favor.*

The shadow wolves receive their orders. As they bite into Derek's creations, something shifts in their demonic eyes. Confusion. Then... submission.

*THUMBS UP. THUMBS UP. THUMBS UP.*

But more than approval - Derek can feel their ENERGY flowing into him. He's not just surviving the demons anymore.

He's CONSUMING them.

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*I understand now. The app doesn't just rate me. It FEEDS me. Every thumb, every star, every judgment... it's all been making me stronger.*

Derek's reflection in the fryer hood now shows a creature barely recognizable as human. Wolf fur, gill slits, hooved feet, and eyes that glow like smartphone screens.

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*Tomorrow's day shift is going to be... interesting.*

*FADE TO SILVER*

<b>END CHAPTER 4</b>

---

<b>CHAPTER 5: THE REFUSAL</b>

*INT. CORNO FAST FOOD - LATE NIGHT (2:00 AM)*

The last customer has left. NIGHT MANAGER CARLOS (30s, just wants to go home) starts flipping chairs onto tables. Derek remains at his post, claws gripping the register.

<b>CARLOS</b>
Alright Derek, good shift. Time to clock out, man.

*Derek's POV: Carlos transforms into a GRIM REAPER figure, his mop becoming a scythe, come to harvest Derek's accumulated power.*

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*The Death Shepherd arrives. He wants to sever my connection to the feeding grounds. If I leave now, I lose everything. The evolutions, the power... it all resets.*

<b>DEREK</b>
*(breathing heavily, gills fluttering)*
I can't. Not yet. I'm so close to the next level.

<b>CARLOS</b>
*(confused)*
Level? Dude, it's 2 AM. We're closed.

*Reality: Derek looks disheveled, his uniform torn in strange places where his transformations have stretched the fabric. Carlos notices something's... off.*

<b>DEREK</b>
*(increasingly frantic)*
You don't understand! The midnight feeding cycle isn't complete. The shadow pack will return at 3:33 AM. If I abandon my post now, they'll sense my weakness!

<b>CARLOS</b>
Derek... what are you talking about, man?

*Derek's POV: The restaurant pulses with ethereal energy. Power lines connect every surface to his transformed body. Leaving would be like unplugging from the Matrix.*

<b>DEREK</b>
*(wolf-eyes gleaming)*
I've consumed their judgment essence for 20 hours straight! My hooves have tasted the sacred grease of dominance! The Toad King himself fears my burger-craft!

<b>CARLOS</b>
*(backing away slowly)*
Okay, that's... that's concerning. Look, I need to lock up. Corporate policy.

<b>DEREK</b>
*(desperate, claws extending)*
ONE MORE HOUR! Just one more evolution! I can feel it building - the FINAL FORM approaches!

*Reality: Derek looks like a wild animal backed into a corner, his eyes bloodshot, muttering about hooves and gills that Carlos can't see.*

<b>CARLOS</b>
*(genuinely worried)*
Derek, when's the last time you went home? Like, actually went home?

<b>DEREK</b>
Home? HOME?! This IS my domain now! Every fryer bubble speaks my name! Every order screen shows my destiny!

Carlos pulls out his phone, probably to call someone. Derek sees this as a SUMMONING RITUAL.

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*He's calling the Corporate Overlords. They'll send the Reset Demons to drain my power!*

<b>CARLOS</b>
*(pleading)*
Please, just... just leave, okay? We'll talk tomorrow. Get some sleep.

Derek's transformed mind snaps. His hooves clatter against the floor as he bolts toward the kitchen.

<b>DEREK</b>
*(running, shouting)*
I WON'T LET YOU RESET MY PROGRESS! THE GRILL CALLS TO ME!

Carlos watches in bewilderment as Derek disappears into the kitchen, the sound of equipment clanging echoing through the empty restaurant.

<b>CARLOS</b>
*(to himself)*
I don't get paid enough for this shit.

*FADE TO CHAOS*

<b>END CHAPTER 5</b>

---

<b>CHAPTER 6: THE FINAL EVOLUTION</b>

*INT. CORNO KITCHEN - NIGHT (2:17 AM)*

Carlos hesitantly pushes through the swinging doors. Derek stands before the grill like a shaman at an altar, his wolf-fur glistening under the heat lamps.

<b>CARLOS</b>
Derek? Come on, man. Let's just—

<b>DEREK</b>
*(without turning around)*
You want to understand? You want to see what I've become?

Derek's hooved feet scrape against the greasy floor as he assembles something magnificent and terrible. This isn't just a burger—it's his MAGNUM OPUS.

<b>DEREK (V.O.)</b>
*The Ultimate Offering. Every evolution, every demon consumed, every thumbs-up absorbed... all concentrated into one perfect creation.*

<b>DEREK</b>
I'm going to make you something special, Carlos. Something that will show you the truth of this place.

The burger takes shape: seven patties (one for each deadly sin), cheese that glows like molten gold, pickles arranged in arcane patterns, sauce that swirls like liquid starlight.

<b>CARLOS</b>
*(mesmerized despite himself)*
Derek, that's... actually beautiful.

Derek turns, his gill-slits pulsing, wolf-eyes reflecting the grill flames.

<b>DEREK</b>
Take it. Taste enlightenment.

Carlos accepts the burger with trembling hands. It's warm, impossibly perfect. He takes a tentative bite.

His eyes widen. The flavors are... transcendent. Umami beyond comprehension. For a moment, pure bliss crosses his face.

<b>CARLOS</b>
This is... this is actually really good—

Then Carlos's expression TWISTS. His skin begins to bubble and shift. His eyes turn black as smartphone screens.

<b>CARLOS</b>
*(voice distorting)*
You fool.

Carlos transforms into a MASSIVE CORPORATE DEMON.

*REALITY SHATTERS*

The kitchen explodes into FAST FOOD HELL. Assassin cows with cleaver hooves stampede from the freezer. The customer demons from his shifts surround him, no longer afraid—they're LAUGHING.
