# The Phone Rule

This is a way of thinking that I've been using to approach the design of software features.

It's very simple, name things in a way that can be used in phone help calls.

Imagine a not very techie person, or a person who is not very interested in the subject, calls you.

The person wants you to be guided to perform an action, or configure the software.

You are in the other end of the call and can only explain through your voice.

If the software is labeled properly you can point to components verbally without sounding dumb or vague.

For example if you decided to name a bookmarks button `"BMarks"` because it's shorter, now you have to say `"Click on um ... Bee Marks"`.

And that sounds confusing and silly. You want to say `"Click on Bookmarks"`.

So the button should be labeled `"Bookmarks"` even if it can be problematic about horizontal space.

The labels should be self-contained, don't strip away important words just because they're inside a certain category.

For instance if if you have an `"Icons"` settings category where you can customize icons it's better to add the `"Icon"` word to every item.

For example `"Activity Icon"`, `"Urgent Icon"`, instead of `"Activity"`, and `"Urgent"`.

Because if you're on the phone it's a lot clearer to say `"Modify the Activity Icon"`, instead of `"Modify Activity"`.

So, simple rule. Label things in a way that can be easy to point to using your voice only.

Why? Well, because you might actually have to explain steps through your phone.

And it might be overall more obvious to all users that use the software.

This is something I thought about while developing [Grasshopper](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/grasshopper-urls/).
