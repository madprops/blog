# Adet

At the bottom of sites you'll usually find `about` pages.

Everybody knows what a `faq` is, if you care to read it.

Another thing some might care to read is the established traditions of the site or community.

Instead of learning through experience, observation, or trial and error, common practices of a community could be summarized in a page you can link as well.

For instance "We quote things others said with >".

Or "We don't link dubbed anime videos".

Not a rule listing, just suggestions to take you out of the noob zone quickly.

But also, it can define features that don't have to exist in code, like usage patterns.

For instance: `Instead of having a button to suggest videos, users paste the link prepended by "see:", like "see: https://major.cas`.

Which the system then can use to build parsers and other components around that tradition, without having to incorporate much in code, which can avoid some complexity.

## Name

It needs a nice name, easy and short, like `faq`.

I suggest the word `adet`. It's a turkish word:

Adet (noun): A customary practice, established tradition, or habitual behavior that is regularly observed and followed within a particular culture, community, or by an individual. It refers to conventional norms, rituals, or ways of conduct that have become institutionalized through repeated practice over time. The term encompasses both personal habits and collective social customs that are considered standard or expected within a given context, often carrying cultural significance and being passed down through generations as part of traditional practices or social conventions.

Turks use "adet" pretty casually - like "bu bizim adetimiz" (this is our custom/tradition) when talking about family or cultural stuff they always do. They'll say it about everything from holiday traditions to daily habits to social norms. It's like their go-to word for "that's just how we do things" or "it's tradition."

To find this name I asked a bunch of stuff to an ai to get some suggestions, I'm not turkish.

Site owners would then have an `adet.html` section in their site, probably linked at the bottom near the other about pages.

I think `adet` is a good word because there's no similar english  word in use right now, that I know of. It's short and its meaning and role can be learned quickly.

And the document itself is helpful because communities tend to acquire lots of traditions through the years, and I've seen new users getting schooled on how to do things, when they could be put up to speed from the get go.

It's not `rules and guidelines`, it's traditions and patterns.

The point of this blog post is to propose making that kind of document a thing.
